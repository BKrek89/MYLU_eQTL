This directory is composed of the bioinformatic work up for the genotype data used in this project. Users could follow part1 - part3 in order.

Part1 is the bioinformatic code for filtering raw sequencing reads.

Part2 is the code for the alignment of filtered reads to the reference genome.

Part3 is the code for SNP calling using ANGSD.

The Linkage Disequilibrium file contains the code to determine pairwise LD between SNP loci using ngsLD and construct a linkage disequilibrium decay plot in R. This should be done after completion of part3.
